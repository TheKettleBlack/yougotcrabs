# You Got Crabs
## A game by TheKettleBlack 2025
### In this game, you control a wizard who is being attacked by crabs. Over 50 levels, the player will use clever movement methods to move around. If an crab collides with a ghost or another crab, they turn into ghosts. If the player collides with a ghost or a crab, the level ends (but you'll start that level over so you can try again).
